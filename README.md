GraphQL Codegen.

Examples:

For that <a href="https://github.com/Warxcell/graphql-codegen/blob/main/tests/schema.graphql">graphql SDL schema</a>
you get that <a href="https://github.com/Warxcell/graphql-codegen/tree/main/tests/Expected">code</a>.

Then you can implement auto-generated interfaces, and that will guarantee that you didn't miss anything.
Furthemore generated interface is strongly typed (with php natives and PSALM/PHPStan annotations) - so, if you have
psalm/phpstan you will have 100% type-safety.
